About me
======

Hello! I'm a PhD student with the Interactive AI Centre for Doctoral Training here at the University of Bristol (UK).
I work mostly with graph neural networks, often with generative models and social networks, but am interested science in general.
I'll add pages here as I go, for new projects and so on, but write the summaries in a more informal way than the papers that go with them.

I grew up in Bristol, then went to Durham University for my MPhys in Physics and Astronomy. 
After having more fun with coding and data than with general relativity I came back to Bristol for an MSc in Data Science, but still had a thesis focussing on astronomy.
Since late 2021 I've been working on my PhD on synthetic social network generation, and graphs more broadly, with Nirav Ajmeri and Telmo de Menezes e Silva Filho as supervisors.
