Lab assistant on the [SDPA module](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=24%2F25&unitCode=EMATM0048).
Students start with (assumed) no knowledge of Python or programming, then learn through lectures and lab sessions until they can tackle the advanced topics later in their course.
My work consisted of assisting and leading students in two or three hour labs.
