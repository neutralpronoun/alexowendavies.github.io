Teaching assistant on the [Intro to AI module](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=24%2F25&unitCode=EMATM0067).
The students here were remote leaners, primarily professionals looking to reskill.
My work was mostly assisting during their lectures and the labs that ran immediately after.
This included frequent out-of-hours online drop-ins due to the students' busy schedules.
