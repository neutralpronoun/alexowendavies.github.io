Here I ran a seminar on financing innovation for the [TIBS module](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=24%2F25&unitCode=EMATM0049).
These seminars, in particular when discussing financial intricacies, can run a little dry, so I decided to structure the first half of the seminar as a quiz.
This included victory kit-kats for the winning team.
The second half was then run as a discussion sessions, but I avoided calling out individual students to speak.
